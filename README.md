# Learning Linear-Quadratic Regulators without Stabilizing Parameter Sets via Thompson Sampling with Preconditioned Langevin Dynamics

This repository includes Matlab implementation of the experimental result of the paper titled above. 

1. Preparation
   * Generation of asymmetric noises (5 and 10 - dimensional ) should be preceded.
   (1) asymmetric&gaussian_mixture - TSLD-LQ-10D_asymmetric - ULA_asymmetric_10D
   (2) asymmetric&gaussian_mixture - TSLD-LQ-5D_asymmetric - ULA_asymmetric_5D
   (3) asymmetric&gaussian_mixture - TSLD-LQ-3D_asymmetric - ULA_asymmetric_3D
